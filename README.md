## Regional Carbon Intensity & Industrial Dependency in CEE
### Overview
This project investigates how regional manufacturing emissions evolve across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and explores how these patterns relate to industrial dependency, FDI-led restructuring, and differences in energy systems.
Using newly available NUTS-2 regional emissions data (1990–2023), we aim to identify distinct decarbonisation profiles across regions and understand why some remain more carbon-intensive than others.
The project combines data-driven regional typologies with structural explanatory variables to produce a comparative account of carbon lock-in across CEE.
